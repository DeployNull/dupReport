2.1.0
-----
Large-scale rewrite of code:
	- Migrated to a python class-based structure and split code into multiple modules. Will make the
      code much easier to maintain going forward.
	- Changed from comparing date/time strings to using timestamps. Makes date comparisons and
	  time tracking much simpler.
	- Simpler date/time format matching. Should eliminate (all?) local date/time format issues from 2.0.x series.
	- New 'grouped' report format. Report on backup activiy grouped by source, destination, or execution date

Changed bahavior of -i option (again!). After initialization, if program can continue, it will. Also eliminated 
            undocumented -I option.

2.0.4
-----
Issue #18, #19, #21 - Several iterations of fixes for these issues. Should now be able to handle most
            global date formats. Probably.

2.0.3
-----
Issue #1 - Initialization with -i option will now always stop program after initialization. 
           Non-critical changes/updates to the .rc file will now allow the program to continue 
           with default option configs.
Issue #7 - Fixed the way failed backup jobs are parsed & reported.
Issue #8 - Flush file buffer after every log write
Issue #10 - Added ability to sort the report by source or destination
Issue #12 - Added level 3 logging and changed logging scheme
Issue #13 - Fixed 24-hour date conversion errors
Issue #14 - Deal with binary-encoded messages from mutant email senders.
Non-Specific:
    - general code cleanup and beautification


2.0.2
-----
Issue #5:
- Subject found but no delimiter found. Program now abandons message with a level 2 log message.
- Regular expression used as delimiter character. Delimiter character now escaped by using re.escape() around variable
